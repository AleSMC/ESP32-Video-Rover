# 🚜 ESP32-Video-Rover

> **Hybrid WiFi RC vehicle with MJPEG video transmission and UDP control.**

This project implements a remote-controlled rover using an **ESP32-CAM** (AI Thinker). The system operates under a **"Solid Axle"** topology (Unified Rear Traction) to ensure startup stability and resource efficiency, featuring Ackermann steering via a servo motor.

## 🛠 Hardware & Connections

**Platform:** ESP32-CAM (AI Thinker Model) with modified external antenna.
**Traction Topology:** Parallel (Solid Axle). Both rear motors receive the same PWM signal.

> ℹ️ **Full Details:** See the setup guide, netlist, and warnings in [docs/hardware_setup.md](docs/hardware_setup.md).

| Logic Signal       | ESP32 Pin | L298N Connection | Technical Notes                     |
| :----------------- | :-------- | :--------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **PWM (Speed)**    | GPIO 13   | ENA + ENB        | Bridged. Power Control (0-100%).    |
| **Dir Fwd**        | GPIO 14   | IN1 + IN3        | Bridged. Forward Gear.              |
| **Dir Rev**        | GPIO 15   | IN2 + IN4        | Bridged. Reverse Gear.              |
| **Steering Servo** | GPIO 2    | PWM Signal       | Shares line with Flash LED.         |
| **Reserved (R&D)** | GPIO 12   | **NC**           | _Not Connected_ to avoid Boot Fail. |

> **Note:** The _Brownout Detector_ has been disabled in software to prevent resets caused by motor current spikes.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Firmware)

### Prerequisites

- VSCode with **PlatformIO** extension.
- CH340 Driver (if using MB base) or FTDI adapter.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the root folder in VSCode.
3. Create the credentials file:
   Copy `firmware/include/secrets_example.h` to `firmware/include/secrets.h` and fill in your WiFi details.

### Build & Upload

    # From PlatformIO Terminal
    cd firmware
    pio run -t upload

_If upload fails:_ Hold the `IO0` button (or connect GPIO0 to GND) and press Reset before uploading.

### Monitoring

To see debug logs (Assigned IP, Motor State):

    pio device monitor -b 115200

## 📡 Network Architecture

- **Hybrid Mode:** Tries to connect to STA (Home WiFi). If it fails after 10s, it deploys the AP "Rover-Emergency".
- **Discovery:** mDNS enabled at `rover.local`.
- **Protocols:**
  - **Video:** HTTP Server (MJPEG Stream).
  - **Control:** UDP (Default Port: `UDP_PORT` in config).
- **Safety (Failsafe):** 1000ms Watchdog. If no UDP packets are received, motors stop.

> **⚠️ SAFETY NOTE (REVERSE):**
> Reverse logic is **disabled in base firmware** (Phase A) to prevent Back-EMF current spikes. Safe reverse implementation (with Dynamic Dead Time) is handled via the Python Client in advanced stages.

## ✅ Development Roadmap

- [x] **Step D:** UDP Control Protocol.
  - **Architecture:** Fire-and-Forget unidirectional communication for low latency.
  - **Port:** `9999` (Configurable).

    - `Byte[1]` **Steering:** `0-180` (Servo Angle).
  - **Safety (Failsafe):** **1000ms** Timeout -> Emergency Brake.
- [x] **Step E:** Python Client (PC) v1.0.
  - **Input:** Migration to `pynput` (Hardware Input) supporting diagonals (W+A) and combos (Shift/Space).
  - **Video:** Asynchronous decoding in dedicated thread to eliminate rendering lag.
  - **Network:** Rate Limiting **(5Hz)** to prevent RX buffer saturation on ESP32.
- [ ] **Extra Step (Bonus):** Dynamic Reverse Control.
  - Implement safety logic in Python to calculate required braking time based on previous speed before sending reverse commands.
- [ ] **R&D Phase (Bonus):** Electronic Differential Research. Evaluate viability of safely using GPIO 12 (Strapping Pin).

## 💻 Software Architecture (PC Client)

The Python client (`software/main.py`) is designed following **Real-Time System** patterns to decouple vision from control.

### 1. Asynchronous Video Pipeline (`VideoStream.py`)

Unlike basic OpenCV examples that block the main loop, this system uses `threading`:

- **Background Thread:** Constantly downloads MJPEG frames and keeps only the latest one in memory (`buffer_size=1`). If processing is slow, it drops old frames to ensure we always see the "present".
- **Main Thread:** Only handles painting the already decoded image, ensuring 0ms blocking on control.

### 2. Hardware Interrupt Piloting (`KeyboardPilot.py`)

Uses the **`pynput`** library:

- **Advantage:** Reads physical key states (Press/Release events).
- **Capability:** Allows complex combinations like **Drift (W+A+Space)**, perfect diagonals, and variable speed control (Shift for precision) without "ghosting".
- **Priority Logic:**
  1. `S` (Brake) > `W` (Throttle).
  2. `Shift` (Precision) > `Space` (Turbo) > Normal.

### 3. UDP Traffic Management (Rate Limiting)

The ESP32 has a single antenna (Half-Duplex). To prevent collisions between Video Upload and Command Download:

- The client limits UDP packet transmission to **200ms (5Hz)**.
- This frees up the air spectrum 90% of the time, allowing video to flow without interruptions.
